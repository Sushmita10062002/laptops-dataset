Welcome to the Laptops Dataset project! This repository contains the code and data for extracting, cleaning, and analyzing 
laptop data.
Here's a brief overview of the project.

### Dataset Creation 📚🔧
The comprehensive dataset of laptops is created by web scraping popular laptop website.
The process involves using Selenium and Chrome WebDriver to extract the HTML of each laptop's page. Next, Python and BeautifulSoup are utilized to parse the HTML, extract features,
and content, resulting in the creation of a Pandas DataFrame. The extracted dataset is saved as laptops.csv.

### Data Cleaning 🧹✨
The cleaning process is crucial to ensure the dataset's accuracy and usability. 
The Python code used for cleaning the dataset is in the cleaning folder. This code efficiently handles missing values, 
addresses any inconsistencies, making the dataset ready for analysis.

### Kaggle Dataset 📊🌐
The cleaned laptop dataset is available on Kaggle, making it easily accessible to the community.
You can download it directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sushmita36/laptops-dataset) and 
use it for your projects or analysis.

### Data Cleaning and EDA using SQL 🧹📊💼
Apart from the primary dataset, I have also included another laptop dataset available at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehtishamsadiq/uncleaned-laptop-price-dataset).
This time, I adopted a different approach to data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using SQL.
The SQL scripts for cleaning and EDA are available in the EDA folder of this repository.
The code demonstrate how to process data using SQL which
provide an alternative perspective on data manipulation and analysis.
